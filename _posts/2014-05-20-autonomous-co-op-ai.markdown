More updates for upcoming features in [0.5.6](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues?milestone=16&state=open). Improvements to the co-op AI means that even if all human players die, the AI will attempt to go around the map and complete all objectives.

The AI still needs some optimisation; on large maps with long paths, the pathfinding can cause huge slowdowns in the game.

A few other updates shown in the video:

- Muzzle flash
- Ricochet sounds (when bullets hit the wall)
