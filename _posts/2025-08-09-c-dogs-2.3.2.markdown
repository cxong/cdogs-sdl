Hey there, another out-of-band release that fixes crashes when loading classic campaigns. These are basically the ones from the mission pack. Reminder that you can get these from the [downloads page](https://cxong.github.io/cdogs-sdl/downloads.html), and contains a hodgepodge of user-created campaigns from back in the day. The quality is often lacking but it can be fun to mix things up a bit!
