Let's close off 2024 with a minor release of C-Dogs SDL!

This one was unplanned but has quite a number of small, mostly UX-related fixes and improvements. Two highlights:

1. New icons! Commissioned from pixel artist [misnina.com](https://misnina.com), this gives a fresh new look to the program bundle.

2. Most changes for this release came from outside contributors!

C-Dogs SDL wouldn't be the same without these contributions. Thank you and enjoy the release!
