New year new C-Dogs SDL minor release! This release adds a new high score system, with lots of added features. Check it out!

Compared to the old version, this adds:

- Time taken
- Kills
- Accuracy
- Favorite Gun/weapon
- Face

Which should make it much more useful. Want to challenge yourself to a speed run, or maybe a pacifist run? How about 100% accuracy? Now you can track it all with this system.

It's a feature that I've wanted to add for [many many years](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/151). It turned out to be a much bigger task than anticipated, and warranted a complete rewrite of the high score system. Unfortunately it is also backwards incompatible - more details are in the previous post. I hope it was worth it and you'll enjoy it!
