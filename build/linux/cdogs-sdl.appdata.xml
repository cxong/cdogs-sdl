    <p>
      C-Dogs is an arcade shoot-em-up which lets players work alone and
      cooperatively during missions or fight against each other in the
      “dogfight” deathmatch mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customize your player, choose from many weapons, and blast, slide and
      slash your way through over 100 user-created campaigns.
